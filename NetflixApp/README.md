It fetches data from the [TMDB (The Movie Database)](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/) to display various movies and TV shows categorized by genre. When you click on a movie or a show, it displays the trailer for that paticular movie or tv show.  

## Features  
- **Data Fetching**: Retrieve and display movies and TV shows from the TMDB database.
